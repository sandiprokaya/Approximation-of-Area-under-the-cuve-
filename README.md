# Approximation-of-Area-under-the-cuve-
Numerical integration is a commonly used technique in applied mathematics and engineering for approximating the value of a definite integral using a numerical method. The Newton-Cotes formula is a family of numerical integration methods that use equally spaced points to approximate the integral of a function. Mostly Trapezoidal rule, Simpson's 1/3 rule, and Simpson's 3/8 rule are widely used due to their simplicity and effectiveness.
The Trapezoidal rule approximates the area under a curve by dividing it into trapezoids. Simpson's 1/3 rule is a more accurate method that approximates the area under a curve by dividing it into parabolic segments, while Simpson's 3/8 rule approximates it by dividing the curve into cubic segments. Although Simpson's 3/8 rule is more accurate than Simpson's 1/3 rule, it requires the evaluation of the function at more points, making it computationally more expensive.
Simpson's 1/3 rule strikes a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, making it the most widely used method for numerical integration. It requires the evaluation of the function at fewer points than Simpson's 3/8 rule while providing higher accuracy than the Trapezoidal rule. Hence, Simpson's 1/3 rule is considered the best of accuracy and efficiency over other methods, making it a popular choice in various fields of science and engineering.

# Trapezoidal Rule
The trapezoidal rule is a numerical integration method that approximates definite integrals. It divides the interval into trapezoids and sums their areas to estimate the integral. By approximating the function with straight line segments, it calculates the area of each trapezoid. The rule states that the integral is approximately equal to the interval width multiplied by the average of the function values at the endpoints. The accuracy depends on the number of trapezoids used. Although it has limitations with highly curved functions, the trapezoidal rule is widely used for its simplicity and reasonable accuracy in many applications.
